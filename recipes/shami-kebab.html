        <h1>Shami Kebab</h1>
        <img src="../recipe-img/shami-kebab.jpg">
        <h2>Decription</h2>
        <p> Shami kebab are not only freezer friendly – as in no detectable change in texture, quality, or taste – they’re also incredibly versatile. Have them with your afternoon chai, as a side to make any dinner menu more abundant, or, my favorite, in a shami kebab sandwich drizzled with ketchup or hot and sour sauce.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 1.5 lb (680 g) ground beef, (preferably full-fat)
            </li>
            <li> 1 cup (195 g) chana dal (yellow split peas), washed and soaked for at least 1 hour (up to overnight), then drained
            </li>
            <li>3/4 cup water for Instant Pot or 4 1/2 cups water for stovetop
            </li>
            <li> 1 (~210-270 g) medium to large onion, roughly chopped
            </li>
            <li>8-10 garlic cloves, leave whole – will be crushed later
            </li>
            <li> 1 1/2 inch (1 1/2 tbsp ) piece ginger, minced or crushed
            </li>
            <li> 1 medium bay leaf
            </li>
            <li> 1/2-1 Tbsp red chili flakes
            </li>
            <li>1 tsp cumin seeds
            </li>
            <li> 2-3 tsp kosher salt – See note 3, will need less if using regular table salt or sea salt
            </li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Grind the whole spices to make a shami kabab masala. If you don’t have a spice/coffee grinder, you may also use a mortar and pestle, though this will be more tedious.
            </li>
            <li> Add the beef, lentils (dal/daal), onion, and spices to the Instant Pot or stovetop along with water. Cook. Sauté out extra moisture.
            </li>
            <li>Pulse to chop up an onion, a green chili pepper, and herbs in a food processor. Remove those and add the beef and lentil mixture. Process until smooth.
            </li>
            <li> Crack in an egg, mix everything and form into patties. Pan-fry.
            </li>
            <li>Awe at how simple it was to actually make these treasures all along.
            </li>
        </ol>
